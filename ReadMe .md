College Bus Tracking

Problem statement :  
The project aims to create a web application for real-time tracking of college buses to enhance convenience, punctuality, safety, and efficiency for students and staff.

Proposed solution :           
 This project aims to develop a real-time college bus tracking web application. By using GPS modules (e.g., NEO-6M) and ESP-32 boards, live location data will be captured and displayed. The web app, built with Django, will feature real-time updates via WebSockets, providing an interactive map interface for users and an admin panel for managing routes and schedules.

Project outcome :
The college bus live location tracking web application will provide students and staff with real-time bus locations via an interactive map interface. The system will enhance convenience, punctuality, safety, and efficiency in college transportation by integrating GPS modules with ESP-32 boards and leveraging Django for backend processing and WebSockets for real-time updates.
